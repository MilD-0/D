            There are many great games that can't be fully experienced becasue of language barriers, although some of them get picked up by localisation companies, most of them are never translated except when dedicated fans pick up the task.

          <p>
            Many tools exist that automatically translate a game but they were never quite satisfying, though by implementing the latest A.I LLMs the translation are more accurate and readable than ever especially in the JP to ENG scene, tools like translator++ which this guide will focus on.

        </p>
        <p>Then click create project, after which you must wait while the tool is extracting the text so it will be ready for translation. </p>

            After Translator++ has created the workspace for your game, go to option in the top right corner, choose your translation engine and language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Next,go back to the main screen, where you will see a window listing the various text files the game has, you can click these files to translate individual elements or columns, but for simplicity just check the box right of the files on the window to perform a batch translation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, with all the files checked click batch translation on the top of the screen, which will promt a window to show up, select your translation engine of choice then click translate now (this will take some time...) .

           To actually apply your translaion, click inject/apply translation on the top of the screen, where you will select the directory of the tranlated game, and choose a folder where a translated copy will be created .
          </p>
            Hit apply translation and wait.
          <p>
            Finally, your translated game should be in that directory for you to enjoy.

            Some limitations which Translator++ may suffer from or some details this guide may not have touched:
            <ul>
                <li>This guide is meant for those who have no other option than to rely on AI translation and not for those looking to fully translate a game to share it, as it simplifies many elements of translating the game to only keep what you need to get the game from ja to en automatically and quickly. </li>
                <li>Translator++ is a versatile tool, but it produces better results with RPG maker games and visual novels, while you need other steps to translate unity games, and it can only translate text.</li>
                <li>some transaltion engines may not be able to translate some things while other ones will not be able to translate other thing, you should try 2 other if the first one doesn't do well.</li>
                <li>of course, this is not a perfect tool, so some games will just not work, and proffesional human transaltion will always be better.</li>
